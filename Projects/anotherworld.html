            <p>The A New World project was a challenge to model a world for humans to move on to after Earth. In the context of this project, Earth has become uninhabitable, and we must move on to another planet where we may be able to live and prosper. For this project I had to keep in mind the requirements for living, as well as things humans need to be innovative. We had to design a planet that had a certain threat to humanity, and design a way to deal with the threat so the human race could prosper. In this project we used Inventor Studio to create a rendered image to showcase our world in a professional style. We used an Inventor Studio render video to professionally showcase our world to consumers. Inventor Studio can be used to create impressive looking representations of actual products you plan to sell, to leave a lasting impression on your consumers.

            <p>The planet that I created is named Planet Crosh, it has a city on it that is protected by a glass dome for humans to survive the harsh weather of the planet. The dome has been designed to keep the humans alive in an environment similar to Earth. The Society would have manual jobs done by robots, and creative jobs done by humans. Details about the city's buildings and construction can be found on the Technical Drawing PDF packet on the right.
